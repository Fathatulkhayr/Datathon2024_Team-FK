Dathaton2024_TeamFK
Project Overview
This project focuses on data preprocessing, analysis, and machine learning model training for the Datathon 2024 challenge. The notebook includes exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation to derive meaningful insights and improve predictive performance.

Dataset Information
The dataset is preprocessed and analyzed before machine learning models are trained. Key steps include handling missing values, feature encoding, and scaling.

Workflow
Data Preprocessing and Analysis

Handling missing values using SimpleImputer
Encoding categorical variables using LabelEncoder
Scaling numerical features with StandardScaler
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib
Model Training & Evaluation

Implementing machine learning models:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Splitting data into training and testing sets (train_test_split)
Evaluating models using:
Accuracy Score
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report
Model Saving & Deployment

Trained models are saved using joblib for future use.
